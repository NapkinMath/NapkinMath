# NapkinMath

NapkinMath is a tool that alleviates the task of doing annoying calculations when it is time to split a bill at a restaurant.
It takes a mobile first approach to cater to an audience that will be using the app through their mobile devices.

To use this app, simply log in using your google account to get started. Using google Oauth2.0 will provide the app with some more details about you!

Then, enter the initials of each member in your party. Then, simply upload an image of a receipt from your phone or computer into the application.
